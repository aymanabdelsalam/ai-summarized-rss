This NPR Life Kit article features decision coach Nell Wulfhart, who argues that prolonged deliberation often hinders effective decision-making.  Wulfhart, with over ten years of experience helping hundreds of clients, contends that most people spend far too much time analyzing options, paralyzed by a fear of regret.  She posits that accepting the inevitability of some regret is crucial to overcoming this inertia and making quicker, more confident choices.  Instead of endless contemplation, Wulfhart advocates for a more decisive approach.

The article outlines two key exercises Wulfhart uses with her clients.  The first involves prioritizing personal values – not abstract ideals, but the daily aspects that contribute to a fulfilling life – and then evaluating potential decisions based on how well they align with those values.  The second exercise involves envisioning one's ideal life in the short, medium, and long term, and then assessing which options directly contribute to achieving that vision.  An example highlights a client who chose to remain in their current job, despite a more prestigious offer, to better position themselves for their long-term goal of owning a successful business.

Wulfhart further emphasizes the importance of minimizing regret by acting decisively.  She argues that the time lost agonizing over choices often leads to more regret than making a potentially imperfect decision quickly.  She suggests mitigating regret by acknowledging that decisions are based on available information at the time, and that unforeseen circumstances can impact outcomes regardless of the initial choice.  She also advocates for "testing things out" – gaining firsthand experience before committing fully –  as a way to gather real-world data and inform future decisions.  Finally, she cautions against seeking excessive advice, recommending limiting consultations to a small, supportive group of trusted individuals whose values align with one's own, and to avoid those who consistently offer negative feedback.  The article concludes by addressing the common tendency to cling to "sunk costs," urging readers instead to consider the opportunity costs of staying in undesirable situations.
