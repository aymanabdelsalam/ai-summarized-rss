The article "How to Research and Plan a Vacation, Right on Your Phone" highlights the significant evolution of smartphone mapping apps like Google Maps and Apple Maps, transforming them from simple navigation tools into comprehensive travel planning resources.  The author, J.D. Biersdorfer, contrasts the past reliance on physical maps with the current convenience offered by these apps.  The core argument centers on the wealth of features available within both Google Maps and Apple Maps to assist in vacation planning directly from a smartphone.

Both apps allow users to search for businesses and access detailed “place cards” containing addresses, hours of operation, reviews, and other crucial information.  Key functionalities highlighted include the ability to make reservations (OpenTable integration in Google Maps), explore nearby locations ("Explore" tab in Google Maps, "Find Nearby" in Apple Maps), and view immersive 360-degree views of locations (Street View in Google Maps, Look Around in Apple Maps).  The article emphasizes the ease of saving locations of interest for later reference using bookmarking features, organizing these saved places into lists or libraries within the respective apps.  These saved locations, accessible through the "You" tab in Google Maps and the "Library" in Apple Maps, effectively create personalized travel itineraries directly within the app.

In conclusion, the article advocates for utilizing the advanced features of Google Maps and Apple Maps to streamline the vacation planning process.  By showcasing the ease of searching, saving, reviewing, and making reservations all within the apps, the author demonstrates how these tools effectively eliminate the need for cumbersome traditional methods, providing a user-friendly and comprehensive solution for researching and organizing a trip entirely on a smartphone.
